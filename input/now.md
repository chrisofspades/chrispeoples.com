Title: Now

I've been inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) and the /now page [movement](https://nownownow.com) to share what's currently going in my life:

- I moved recently.
- I'm furniture shopping for the first time in decades. Questions I get asked that I have no answers for: What's your style? What do you like? I don't know!
- I got a new poker table and am looking forward to breaking it in.
- I'm learning Vue.js for a work-related project.
- I'm reading *A Man With One of Those Faces* by Caim McDonnell.
