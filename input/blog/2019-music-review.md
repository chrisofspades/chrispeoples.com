Music was a bit of a mixed bag for me in 2019. I listened to less music than usual because my commute was reduced drastically, so I had less time to check out new music and rediscover old favorites. However, music brought me one of proudest moments of the year when my daughter randomly said to me, "I need to listen to more Rapsody." That we all do, Daughter! Rap's *Eve* was my favorite record of the year. And with that, on to the categories:
