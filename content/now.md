<small>(I've been inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) and the /now page [movement](https://nownownow.com) to share what's currently going in my life.)</small>

## Puzzles

I've become addicted to star battle type puzzles. It began with [LinkedIn Queens](https://www.linkedin.com/games/queens), progressed to [Game of Crowns](https://gameofcrowns.sanish.me), and coalesced at [Star Battle Baron](https://starbattle.puzzlebaron.com/). The amount of daily puzzles that I play has grown to epic proportion.

## Live Shows

I really enjoy taking in live music and comedy. I also really enjoy tracking my activity. I was very happy to find [Concert Archives](https://www.concertarchives.org), which allows you track the live performances you've attended. Check out [my profile](https://www.concertarchives.org/chrisofspades)!
