I've been inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) and the /now page [movement](https://nownownow.com) to share what's currently going in my life:

- I'm in the process of refinancing my home. Rates were just too good to resist.
- Basketball has taken over my life. So much WNBA and NBA.
- I'm currently reading *The Time Machine* by H.G. Wells.
