I've been inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) and the /now page [movement](https://nownownow.com) to share what's currently going in my life:

- My daughter and I started laying the groundwork for relaunching Father Daughter Book Club. I'm excited! I'm looking forward to podcasting again.
- I'm happy to be employed and healthy. There was some uncertainty there at the beginning of March, and the pandemic and subsequent quarantine really threw things for a loop. Fortunately things are mostly back to normal.
- The amount of sadness, grief, and despair I feel over the continued slaughter of Black people at the hands of police is hard for me to verbalize. I'll just leave it at that.
- I'm currently reading *The Testing* by Joelle Charbonneau, and *The Likely Resolutions of Oliver Clock* by Jane Riley.
