I've been inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) and the /now page [movement](https://nownownow.com) to share what's currently going in my life:

- I'm looking for ways to be more active on this website. Hopefully you'll be seeing more content here in 2020.
- I'm fully engaged in a project for work that has been one of the most rewarding in my career. I get to learn new technologies, work with brilliant people, and really get to stretch my legs and flex my muscles as a developer and technical lead.
- I'm enjoying spending time with daughter and family during. I took a short respite from work and it's been nice getting to spend time with loved ones.
- I'm looking forward to the next decade! I can't believe this one is already coming to a close.
- I'm reading *Game Changer* by Douglas E. Richards.
