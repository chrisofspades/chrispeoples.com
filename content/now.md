<small>(I've been inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) and the /now page [movement](https://nownownow.com) to share what's currently going in my life.)</small>

## Work

Work was incredibly busy this year. We started out short-staffed, but we've slowly been adding developers back to the team so the work is starting to even out. I just completed one of the largest projects of my career, a migration from Blackboard to Zoom for all of our virtual classroom delivery. It was a grind getting it done but the transition was smooth and I'm extremely proud of it.

## Entertainment

Before everything got locked down again I went axe-throwing. Most fun I've had since Top Golf. I highly recommend it.

I'm currently reading *Dune* by Frank Herbert. I understand why it's considered a sci-fi classic. It's a big book but I expect to be done by the end of the year.

I'm currently watching Big Mouth season 4, Lucifer season 3, Jessica Jones season 3, and Mr. Iglesias season 2. 

## Life

Southern California is under a regional stay-at-home order due to COVID-19, so I've been keeping mainly to myself. Just hoping to get out of 2020 all in one piece.
