2025 was a year like any other. I'm terrible at writing these retrospectives, hence why it's already February and I'm just now publishing it. Which is worse, posting a year in review in two a month after the year starts, or sending out the yearly wrapped/recap/some-other-fancy-name two months before the year even ends? I'm looking at you, Spotify, YouTube, Netflix, etc. etc. etc. How can you possibly know who my top artists of the year are going to be if you stop counting in November? A lot can change in those final two months; I first listened to the song that would eventually become my most listened of the year on October 9th! Kudos to Last.fm for being the only service that waited until January to release their playback. Rant over, let's break down some numbers.

## Listening

I had **12,414 scrobbles** in 2025! This translates to **2,211 artists**, **3,914 albums**, and **7,806 tracks**. 37% of those artists were new discoveries, but KAMAUU and Samm Henshaw definitely stood out the most. I came across KAMAUU late in the year and had "BOA" on repeat so fast that it became my top song of the year!

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the passings of Sly Stone and D'Angelo, two artists both near and dear to my heart. May they both rest in peace.

## Watching

I watched **47 movies**, **13 stand-up specials**, and **56 TV shows** in 2025! Some of the movie highlights were *Dune: Part Two*, *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes*, and *Rebel Ridge*.  *Travelers*, *Mr. & Mrs. Smith*, *A.P. Bio*, and *The Expanse* impressed me on television. Unfortunately none of the stand-up specials really stood out, with the exception of maybe Dave Chappelle and Neal Brennan.

## Gigging

I tried to make an effort to attend more live shows in 2025, but unfortunately only managed five shows. The Main Squeeze in February was outstanding. They were on my bucket list of artists that I've wanted to see and they did not disappoint. Bilal in September was also something special. He put on an memorable performance in a very unique venue.
