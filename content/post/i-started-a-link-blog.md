I don't tweet anymore, I've yet to join Threads or Bluesky, and I never really got into Mastodon. You would think that might lead to more blogging, but I don't often find myself with something significant or coherent enough to share in a blog post. I do, however, want a place to share things that I find fun and interesting on the internet, with perhaps a short note or highlight from them, so here it is: my very own [link blog](/links)! 

I'm actually pretty excited and hopeful about it. Currently I'm manually managing it, but I hope to automate it in the future. I'm already using [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) for my bookmarks, and the service has a friendly looking API that I can leverage to power the link blog. Once I get around to adding an RSS feed for it, it will be a true and proper link blog.

## Future 

- [ ] RSS feed
