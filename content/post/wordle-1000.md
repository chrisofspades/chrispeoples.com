Every morning since January 13, 2022, I've faithfully done the same thing: played the daily Wordle. I never expected that I would continue that habit for over 1000 days, but here we are. It's become a daily ritual because it combines two of my favorite things: word games and puzzles. Since I also love numbers and statistics, I started tracking my results years ago, and I thought I'd share some fun facts about game play now that I've eclipsed 1000 games.
