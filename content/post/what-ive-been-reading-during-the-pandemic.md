Reading is one of my favorite pastimes, and the pandemic hasn't stopped my appetite for books. I have, however, steered clear of anything dystopian or post-apocalyptic, because who wants to read about that at a time like this! Instead, I've taken in the rare historical fiction novel along with the usual sci-fi and mystery/thriller books. Here are the latest books I've read and some selected highlights from them.

- [*Loving Day* by Mat Johnson](#loving-day-by-mat-johnson)
- [*Exhalation Day* by Ted Chiang](#exhalation-day-by-ted-chiang)
- [*Vanishing in the Haight* by Max Tomlinson](#vanishing-in-the-haight-by-max-tomlinson)
- [*Eye of the Needle* by Ken Follett](#eye-of-the-needle-by-ken-follett)
- [*Prelude to Foundation* by Isaac Asimov](#prelude-to-foundation-by-isaac-asimov)

    <p>And it is a little thing, saying “I’m mixed” instead of “I’m black,” yet it’s like the difference between the comfort of wearing shoes that fit as opposed to bearing the blisters of shoes just one size too small.</p>

## *Exhalation Day* by Ted Chiang

<blockquote class="highlight">
    <p>We don’t normally think of it as such, but writing is a technology, which means that a literate person is someone whose thought processes are technologically mediated. We became cognitive cyborgs as soon as we became fluent readers, and the consequences of that were profound.</p>

## *Eye of the Needle* by Ken Follett

<blockquote class="highlight">
    <p>People my age shouldn’t make pronouncements about life. But my life has been a matter of making do, and the same goes for most of the women I know. Steadfastness always looks like a sacrifice, but usually it isn’t.</p>

    <p>“I can’t bear to hear a human being spoken of with contempt just because of his group identification—even by other human beings. It’s these respectable people here who create those hooligans out there.” “And other respectable people,” said Seldon, “who create these respectable people. These mutual animosities are as much a part of humanity—” “Then you’ll have to deal with it in your psychohistory, won’t you?”</p>
