It's been far too long since I've done a personal year in review. Let's take a look back at what I [read](#reading), [listened to](#listening), and [watched](#watching) in 2023.

## Reading

I read **forty-three books** in 2023! That's a total of **13,759 pages**, with an average book length of **320 pages**. The shortest book was **21 pages** (*Clap Back*, by Nalo Hopkinson), while the longest book was **608 pages** (*Death's End*, by Cixin Liu).

I explored the works of **28 authors**, including Maya Angelou, Connie Willis, Susanna Clarke, Mike Chen, James McBride, Janelle Monae, and Haruki Murakami. I also made it a point in 2023 to read from a diverse set of authors. Since my favorite genre is science fiction it's fairly easy for the bulk of my reading to come from white males, but in 2023 that demographic only accounted for 15% of the authors I read. 

While it's always difficult to pick a single favorite, the books that brought me the most joy last year were *The Hate U Give*, *A Prayer for the Crown-Shy*, and *Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow*.

Here are all of the books I read:

## Listening

I had **7,382 scrobbles** in 2023! This translates to **489 hours** of listening, **1,200 artists**, **2,078 albums**, and **4,496 tracks**.

My top artists were, unsurprisingly, The Roots, Blackalicious, Kendrick Lamar, OutKast, and J-Live. My new discoveries included Dojo Cuts, Cleo Soul, Dijon, Jalen Ngonda, and Kimberose. My favorite new discovery is easily Dijon. While his album *Absolutely* is not a new release, it was a revelation to me. I had "The Dress" on repeat!

I even got to check out some live music, Little Brother in May and The Roots in December. These are two of my favorite acts to see and they did not disappoint. I'm happy to report that they still got it!

## Watching

I watched **62 movies** in 2023! Some of the standouts were *The Woman King*, *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse*, *A Man Called Otto*, and *The Hate U Give*.

I viewed **478 episodes** from **44 shows** in 2023! My favorite overall was *Travelers*, while my favorite new releases were *The Power* and *Night Agent*.
