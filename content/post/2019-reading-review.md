### Fun Numbers

I read a total of **13,818 pages**, with an average book length of **394 pages**. The shortest book was **28 pages** (*Randomize*, by Andy Weir), while the longest book was **748 pages** (*The Song of the Orphans*, by Daniel Price).

I read **22 authors** I hadn't read before, including Aldous Huxley, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Neil Gaiman, Nnedi Okorafor, Patrick Rothfuss, and Ted Chiang.

I've currently been reading for **75 weeks** consecutively. My longest daily streak of 2019 was **115 days**.

### Biggest Surprises

Sometimes I read a book simply because it's been steeply discounted or it's available on Prime Reading. I love it when I thoroughly enjoy these books. I got hooked on **Daniel Price's Silvers series**, and I can't wait until he releases the conclusion in 2020. **Clifford Smoak** had me wondering how I'd never heard of him; *Way Station* was absolutely riveting. But **Fredrik Backman's *A Man Called Ove*** was probably the biggest suprise of the year. It was heart-warming, tearful, and Ove is one of my favorite characters.

### Biggest Disappointments

I read two books in 2019 that are considered sci-fi classics yet underwhelmed me. **Robert Heinlein's *Stranger in a Strange Land*** was interesting and thought-provoking, but ultimately filled with too much misogyny and racism for me to fully enjoy. Heinlein wasn't trying to be controversial&mdash;that I could have respected&mdash;but his language towards women and minorities were either a reflection of the times or his own personal biases and it ruined the book for me.

On the other hand, **Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*** was intentionally controversial and disturbing. I was fascinated with the dystopia he created, until the book devolved into religious advocacy. Less disappointing, but disappointing nonetheless.

### Favorite Book of 2019

Settling on a single favorite is always tough. I finally got around to reading *The Princess Bride*, and it's every bit as fun as the film adaptation. I love Isaac Asimov, and *Robots of Dawn* is no exception. I already mentioned my affinity for the *Silvers* series and Patrick Rothfuss' *The Name of the Wind* is the fantasy series I can finally get behind (sorry, Harry). Many others left a lasting impression, including *The Sellout*, *Stories of Your Life and Others*, and *The Underground Railroad*, but my favorite book of 2019 is...

***A Man Called Ove* by Fredrik Backman.**

Not only was it a pleasant surprise, but it tugged at my heart strings, made me laugh, made me cry, and reminded me why I love to read.
