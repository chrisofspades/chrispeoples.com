I enjoy a good book challenge but some of them are just too daunting (I'm looking at you, r/fantasy). Fortunately this year I found the [What's in a Name Challenge](https://carolinabooknook.wordpress.com/2024/12/26/whats-in-a-name-2025-sign-up/), where each book title must contain the prompt. The challenge is hosted by Andrea at [Carolina Book Nook](https://carolinabooknook.wordpress.com) and runs from January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025. 

The rules are simple:

- Read a book in any format (hard copy, ebook, audio) with a title that fits into each category.
- Don’t use the same book for more than one category.
- Creativity for matching the categories is not only allowed, it’s encouraged!
- You can choose your books as you go or make a list ahead of time.

In 2025, choose 6 books that have titles that contain:

## Cardinal direction ❓

>Titles for this category need to include at least one cardinal direction (North, East, South, West) in the title.

## Wanderlust ✅

>Titles for this category need to include words or phrases related to wanderlust: wander, journey, trip, travel, explore, trek, tour, adventure, etc. Or the implication of traveling or exploring.

## First and last name ✅

>Titles for this category need to include both a first name (given name) and last name (surname). The names don’t matter, as long as it’s the first and last of a real person or fictional character.
