Ibrahim Diallo on leadership:

> By definition, leading is knowing the way forward. But in reality, in a room full of experts, pretending to know everything makes you look like an idiot.
> 
> Instead, "I don't know, but let's figure it out" becomes a superpower. It gives your experts permission to share uncertainty. It models intellectual humility. And it keeps the focus on moving forward rather than defending ego. It's also an opportunity to let your experts shine.
